const add = (a : number, b : number) : number => {

// We add the number as a type of the inputs as well as adding the number as a type in the fucntion so that the function will always expect a number as a return value
// Adding the number as the function type give us a chcek that makes sure we return a number
// It will check whether the function returns the proper value type but not the logic within the function
// When adding an anottation type we need to have a return type in the function body
